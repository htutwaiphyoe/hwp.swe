      <p>
        I am Htut Wai Phyoe, a software engineer in Myanmar. I studied Computer
        Science at Mandalay Technological University but dropped out at 4th
        year. My career began at Codigo as a full-time frontend developer in
        2021. Additionally, I willingly contribute to the community by sharing
        my personal insights through high-quality blogs and podcasts.
