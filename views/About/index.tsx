      <p>
        I am Htut Wai Phyo, a software engineer currently based in Thailand. I
        studied Computer Science at Mandalay Technological University and
        dropped out at 4th year but I pursued my Bachelor degree back in
        University of Greenwich. My career began at Codigo as a full-time
        frontend developer in 2021 and I am working for Rezeve SaaS platform.
        Additionally, I willingly contribute to the community by sharing my
        personal insights through high-quality blogs and podcasts.
